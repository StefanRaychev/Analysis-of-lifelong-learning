On the one hand, it increases the quality of the workforce by maintaining up-to-date knowledge and skills. On the other hand, knowledge is the main tool against the defects of the democratic and market system - corruption, populism, labor and market exploitation, market and non-market imperfections, etc. For this reason, the analysis and promotion of lifelong learning is of vital importance for any government policy.\n\nIn this analysis, we take a brief look at the process of lifelong learning in Europe. The analysis uses Eurostat's database and Eurostat's definition of lifelong learning: \"Lifelong learning covers all lifelong learning activities aimed at improving knowledge, skills and competences in personal, civic, social or employment-related perspectives. The intention or goal of learning is the critical point that distinguishes these activities from non-learning activities, such as cultural or sports activities.\n\nParticipation in education and training is a measure of lifelong learning. The participation rate in education and training covers participation in formal and non-formal education and training. In this section the reference period for the participation in education and training is the four weeks prior to the interview. Participation rates in education and training for various age groups and by different breakdowns are presented.\n\nThe data shown are calculated as annual averages of quarterly EU Labour Force Survey data (EU-LFS).\"\n\nFor more information about the data and methodology: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/trng_lfs_4w0_esms.htm\n\nIn this first stape we make a short glance using the exploratory data analysis on the Participation in education and training (covers participation in formal and non-formal education and training.) over a 18 year period from 2004 to 2021 in sex, education level and age. The data includes EU member states and other Europe countries.
